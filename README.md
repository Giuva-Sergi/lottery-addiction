# lottery-addiction

In this project I used the canadian lottery to calculate some probabilities. I wrote some functions like:

* ```one_ticket_probability``` function that calculates the probability of winning the big prize with one ticket
* ```check_historical_occurance``` function that, given a dataset with historical records, returns as a result how many times the ticket the user chose occured in the past
* ```multi_ticket_probability``` a function that, by giving the number of tickets bought as input, return the probability to win the big price and how much the user would spend
* ```probability_less_6``` calculates the probability of any given number of winning choices from the user.
